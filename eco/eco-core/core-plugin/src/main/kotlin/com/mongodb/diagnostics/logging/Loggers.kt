/*
This is a terrible fix for mongo logging.

I've tried every 'solution' on the internet - setting the level with java native logging,
with Log4j / Slf4j, reflectively changing the logger delegate in the Log4J impl, every
single method under the sun - but I just couldn't get any of them to work.

So, I've 'fixed' the problem at the source - the class in the jar now always returns a useless
logger that can't do anything. At least there's no console spam anymore.
